## About

RepoSnipy is a neural search engine built with [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) and [docarray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray). You can query a public Python repository hosted on GitHub and find popular repositories that are semantically similar to it.

It uses the [RepoSim](https://github.com/RepoAnalysis/RepoSim/) pipeline to create embeddings for Python repositories. We have created a [vector dataset](data/index.bin) (stored as docarray index) of over 9700 GitHub Python repositories that has license and over 300 stars by the time of 20th May, 2023.

## Running Locally

Download the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RepoAnalysis/RepoSnipy
cd RepoSnipy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the app on your local machine using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
